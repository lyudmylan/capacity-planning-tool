# GitHub Planning

## When to use

- The user wants to create or organize GitHub milestones, epics, or issues.
- The user wants to break product direction into GitHub work items.
- The user wants to assign issues, group issues under a milestone, or update roadmap structure.
- The user is planning work, not shipping an already-implemented code change.

## How to use this skill

1. Read `AGENTS.md` first.
2. Use `docs/product.md` as the product source of truth.
3. Inspect existing milestones and issues before creating new ones.
4. Prefer a small, clear structure:
   - milestone first
   - epic issues next
   - implementation issues after that
5. Keep titles concise and stable.
6. In issue bodies, include:
   - goal
   - in scope
   - out of scope
   - notes or source-of-truth reference when useful
7. Assign issues only when the user asks or when the repo workflow clearly calls for it.

## Default workflow

For product planning:

1. Align the work structure to `docs/product.md`.
2. Create or update a milestone when the user is organizing a version or phase.
3. Create epic issues for major workstreams before creating implementation tasks.
4. Link the issue content back to the relevant product direction or functional design.

For issue maintenance:

1. Check whether the target milestone or issue already exists.
2. Update existing issues when that is cleaner than creating duplicates.
3. Keep issue descriptions short and operational.

## What this skill adds

- a consistent GitHub planning workflow for this repo
- milestone-first planning when the user is organizing a release
- epic-first breakdown before task-level issue creation
- issue content grounded in `docs/product.md` instead of ad hoc wording

## Boundaries

- Use `github-shipping` when the user wants to ship, push, merge, or complete code.
- Use this skill when the user wants to structure work in GitHub before or alongside implementation.

# GitHub Shipping

## When to use

- The user asks to ship, push, merge, finish, or complete a routine change.
- The work is already implemented and needs the standard GitHub delivery flow.
- The repo does not explicitly require a different release process.

## How to use this skill

1. Read the repo's `AGENTS.md` first.
2. Apply the repo's shared shipping workflow.
3. If the repo defines stricter or different rules, follow the repo-specific override.
4. Before merging a PR, verify all three review surfaces:
   - PR status/checks
   - top-level PR reviews and comments
   - inline review comments on the diff
5. After CI turns green, do one final review sweep across those same three surfaces.
6. Do not treat a PR as ready just because CI is green.
7. If there are actionable review findings, address them or explicitly decide to defer them before merge.
8. In this repo, prefer `scripts/pr_ready_check.sh <pr-number>` for the final merge-readiness sweep.
9. Respect the `codex-review-gate` required check unless the repo owner explicitly chooses the `codex-review-skipped` override label.

## What this skill adds

Use this skill as the trigger for shipping mode, especially when the user did not restate the whole workflow.

Default review focus:

- behavioral regressions
- missing or weak tests
- broken contracts or schema drift
- error handling gaps
- logging or observability regressions
- hidden hardcoding of change-prone policy

## Pre-Merge Checklist

For GitHub PRs in this repo, check:

1. PR status and checks
   - example: `gh pr view --json state,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup`
2. Top-level PR reviews and comments
   - example: `gh pr view --json reviews,comments`
3. Inline review comments
   - example: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments`
4. Re-run the three review checks once after CI is green and immediately before merge
5. Prefer `scripts/pr_ready_check.sh <number>` as the final single-command summary before merge
6. If `codex-review-gate` is failing, wait for the Codex review to arrive or explicitly apply the `codex-review-skipped` label before merge

If any inline or review comments contain actionable findings, handle them before merge or call them out explicitly to the user.
